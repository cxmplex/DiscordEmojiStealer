# DiscordEmojiStealer

## How to use

Retrieve your client token. The easiest way to do this go to discord.gg in your browser, open the developer console, click network, click XHR, then click a text channel.
View the request, and you'll see an authorization header. This is your token.

There are two options, steal emojis and upload emojis. Upload emojis requires a directory /emojis/ in your current working directory. This is created automatically by steal emojis.
